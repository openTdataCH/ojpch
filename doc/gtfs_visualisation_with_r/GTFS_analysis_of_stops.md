 ## Getting clusters for stops (distance)
  
```R
library(sp)
library(rgdal)
library(geosphere)

# Load GTFS file
xxx
# Load the matrix to work it
xy <-spo_gtfs$stops

# Transform xy into a SpatialPointsDataFrame
coordinates(xy) <- 3:4

# Calculate the distance matrix
mdist <- distm(xy)

# Set the distance to 40 meters
d=40

# Build the clusters
hc <- hclust(as.dist(mdist), method="complete")
xy$clust <- cutree(hc, h=d)

# Print out all clusters that are not simple (containing one element)

subset(xy,clust ==6)@data
subset(xy,clust ==6)@coords
```

## Calculating grouping from the structure in stops.txt
Using parent_station and location_type

**tbd**

# Generalised stop registry
The file contains an extended stops.txt as a master table 

Additional fields are:
- main_id: the id which this stop is grouped into (it is always flattened to a single parent - child relationship regardless how deep the structure is mapped. 
- source_ref: the source that the stop was loaded from (e.g. SBB-OeV)
- harvest_date: the date it was harvested (e.g. 2023-12-01)

Algorithm:
Identical stop_id are flattened into one, when the coordinates match. If the coordinates don't match, they are added.

```
1. Load the main database
2. Load a new GTFS file
3. For each element in the new GTFS file
     Try to use the grouping mechanism
     If a new entry (stop_id) is found
         If it has a master element
           Add it with a main_id
         Else
           Add it with itself as the main_id
         End If
     Else If coordinates are not identical to at least one incarnation of the group defined by the same main_id
        Add it with that main_id
     End If   
   EndFor
 4. Housekeeping: Remove items with the same stop_id,main_id,source_ref but an earlier harvest_date
 5. Save main database 
```

An optimisation could be that we try to define, which source is the master for a given area. This can be achieved by defining the area and check whether a given stop is within it or not. In such an instance the stops with the same main_id should be reorganised and the main_id should be the id of the master.
